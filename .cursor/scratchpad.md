# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
This is a Next.js project for GoViral's landing page. The project uses Next.js 15.3.2, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The site appears to be a marketing landing page for GoViral, a social media service company that helps users grow their presence on various platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Spotify.

The client wants to add a new component to the landing page that allows users to try their Instagram reel view service. Users will need to input their name, email, and Instagram reel URL to receive a trial of views on their reel.

A new requirement has been added: implementing email verification to ensure users provide valid email addresses before receiving the free trial.

An additional requirement is now being considered: creating a customer record in Shopify when a user requests a trial, using the Shopify Storefront API.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The project is built with modern Next.js App Router architecture
- Uses Google Analytics and Google Ads tracking with custom event tracking
- Has a clean, modern design using Geist font family
- The main page is quite large (77KB) with multiple sections including a header, hero section, features, and more
- Includes a plan configurator component and page
- Has Shopify integration for checkout functionality
- The UI follows an Apple-inspired design style with gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, and clean typography
- There are some linter errors related to TypeScript types
- The site includes tracking for various user interactions using Google Analytics events

### New Feature Analysis
For the Instagram reel view trial component, we need to:
1. Create a form component that matches the site's design aesthetic
2. Implement form validation for name, email, and Instagram reel URL
3. Create an API endpoint to handle form submissions
4. Connect to the JustAnotherPanel API to send 500 views to the user's Instagram reel
5. Track form submissions with Google Analytics
6. Provide user feedback (success/error messages)
7. Ensure the component is responsive and accessible
8. Implement a system to prevent abuse of the trial feature
9. Add email verification to validate user emails before processing the trial request
10. Create a customer record in Shopify when a user completes the verification process

### API Integration Details
- API Endpoint: `https://justanotherpanel.com/api/v2`
- API Key: `c8ad1878ef37d9cccb446afb3569121e`
- Service ID: `442` (for 500 Instagram reel views)
- Required parameters:
  - `key`: API key
  - `action`: "add" (to add an order)
  - `service`: Service ID
  - `link`: Instagram reel URL
  - `quantity`: 500 (for the trial)

### Email Verification Plan

#### Problem Statement
Currently, users can submit any syntactically valid email address to receive the free trial, but there's no verification that the email actually belongs to the user. This could lead to:
1. Abuse of the free trial system
2. Collection of invalid email addresses
3. Reduced effectiveness of follow-up marketing efforts

#### Requirements
1. Send a verification email with a unique code/link to the user's email address
2. Require the user to verify their email before processing their trial request
3. Store pending trial requests until verification is complete
4. Provide clear user feedback throughout the verification process
5. Implement timeout for verification links (e.g., 24 hours)
6. Track verification metrics (sent, completed, expired)

#### Selected Solution: Email Verification with Verification Code

We'll implement an email verification system that sends a 6-digit verification code to the user's email. This approach offers:

- **Security**: Ensures the user owns the email address they provided
- **User Experience**: Simple verification process without requiring complex token handling
- **Flexibility**: Can be extended with additional security features if needed
- **Analytics**: Enables tracking of verification completion rates

#### Implementation Details

1. **User Flow**:
   - User submits form with name, email, and Instagram reel URL
   - System validates inputs and checks for duplicate trials
   - If valid, system generates a 6-digit verification code
   - System sends verification email and stores pending request
   - User receives email with verification code
   - User enters verification code on the website
   - If code is correct, system processes the trial request
   - If code is incorrect, user can request a new code (with rate limiting)

2. **Data Structure for Pending Verifications**:
   ```json
   {
     "pendingVerifications": [
       {
         "email": "user@example.com",
         "name": "User Name",
         "instagramUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/",
         "verificationCode": "123456",
         "createdAt": 1686123456789,
         "expiresAt": 1686209856789,
         "attempts": 0
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Email Template**:
   - Clean, branded email design matching the website's aesthetic
   - Clear instructions for using the verification code
   - Verification code displayed prominently
   - Link back to the website
   - Support information

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/reel-trial/request`: Create a new trial request and send verification email
   - `POST /api/reel-trial/verify`: Verify the code and process the trial if valid

5. **Key Functions**:
   - `generateVerificationCode()`: Generate a random 6-digit code
   - `sendVerificationEmail()`: Send the verification email
   - `createPendingVerification()`: Store the pending verification
   - `verifyCode()`: Check if the provided code matches
   - `processTrial()`: Process the trial after successful verification
   - `cleanupExpiredVerifications()`: Remove expired verification requests

## Anti-Abuse System Plan

### Problem Statement
We need to prevent users from abusing the free trial feature by submitting multiple requests for the same Instagram account or from the same person.

### Requirements
1. Limit one trial per Instagram account/reel URL
2. Limit one trial per email address
3. Maintain a record of trials to enforce these limits
4. Provide clear feedback when a user has already used the trial

### Selected Solution: JSON File Storage

We'll implement a file-based storage solution using a JSON file to track trial submissions. This approach offers:

- **Persistence**: Data persists across all users and server restarts
- **Simplicity**: No external database dependencies
- **Security**: Data stored on the server is more secure than client-side solutions
- **Flexibility**: Can be easily migrated to a database solution later if needed

#### Implementation Details

1. **File Structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "trials": [
       {
         "email": "user@example.com",
         "instagramUrl": "https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/",
         "reelId": "ABC123",
         "timestamp": 1686123456789
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Storage Location**:
   - Create a `data` directory in the project root
   - Store the JSON file at `data/trials.json`
   - Add the directory to `.gitignore` to prevent committing user data

3. **Key Functions**:
   - `ensureStorageExists()`: Create the file if it doesn't exist
   - `getTrials()`: Read all trials from the file
   - `addTrial()`: Add a new trial to the file
   - `checkTrialExists()`: Check if an email or reel ID exists in the file

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've completed the implementation of a fallback mechanism for Vercel Blob storage in development mode. Here's what I've done:

1. **Fallback Mechanism**: 
   - Added a complete fallback system that uses file-based storage when Blob storage fails
   - Created a data directory with JSON files for trials and verifications
   - Implemented file-based versions of all storage functions

2. **Development Experience**:
   - The system now works seamlessly in both development and production environments
   - In development, it automatically falls back to file storage if Blob operations fail
   - In production, it will use Vercel Blob exclusively

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the storage layer
   - Added detailed logging with consistent prefixes for easier debugging
   - Gracefully handles Shopify customer creation errors

4. **Shopify Integration**:
   - Successfully validated the Shopify integration
   - Added special handling for duplicate customer emails

The implementation is now complete and ready for deployment. Here are the final steps needed:

1. **Deployment**:
   - Add the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN to Vercel environment variables
   - Add the SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN to Vercel environment variables
   - Deploy the application to Vercel

2. **Testing**:
   - Test the complete flow in production
   - Verify that Blob storage works correctly in the Vercel environment
   - Test the Shopify customer creation in production

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up error monitoring for API failures
   - Monitor Blob storage usage and quotas
   - Set up alerts for critical failures

## Lessons
- Vercel Blob requires proper authentication even in development environments
- Implementing a fallback mechanism is crucial for smooth development experience
- Handling duplicate customer emails in Shopify requires specific error checking
- Consistent logging patterns with prefixes (e.g., `[service-name]`) make debugging easier
- Having a robust error handling strategy is essential for serverless applications

# Instagram Reels Trial with Discount Code Implementation
